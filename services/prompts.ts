# CSV Analyzer Skill

## Overview
This skill uses a Node.js script to analyze CSV files, providing key metadata like column names and row count. It relies on the 'papaparse' library.

## Setup
1.  Navigate to this skill's directory.
2.  Install the required dependency:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`

## Usage
To analyze a CSV file, execute the script via Node.js, passing the file path as an argument:
\`\`\`bash
node scripts/analyze_csv.js path/to/your/file.csv
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

// csv-analyzer/package.json
\`\`\`json

***MODEL ANALYSIS EXAMPLE START***

### Comprehensive Reasoning and Ambiguity Analysis

1.  **Fact 1: The Specific Request for a Shunt Button:**
    The core task is to create a singular operational component, designated "My command," which is referred to as a "shunt button." In this context, a "shunt button" likely represents a predefined, reusable command, a templated prompt, or an automated workflow trigger designed to achieve a specific outcome or guide an AI's behavior in a particular way. The request explicitly asks for *one* such button, implying a single, consolidated definition or function.

2.  **Rule 1: The "Follow the Example Below" Mandate – The Core Ambiguity:**
    This rule states that "My command" *must* "follow the example bellow" (singular). This is the nexus of the problem. A directive referring to a singular "example" typically implies that one specific template, pattern, or method should be adopted wholly or primarily. However, the subsequent "Fact 2" immediately introduces a contradiction. The instruction's singular phrasing directly clashes with the plural reality of *four* distinct and potentially competing protocols. This creates an irreconcilable ambiguity:
    *   Does "the example" refer to *any one* of the four, implying a choice needs to be made by the implementer (without criteria)?
    *   Does it refer to *all* of them, requiring some form of synthesis or aggregation that isn't specified?
    *   Is there an implicit priority or a "most representative" example that is not explicitly stated?
    Without further guidance, any attempt to select one example over others, or to arbitrarily combine elements, would be an assumption, potentially leading to an incorrect or unintended "My command" button.

3.  **Rule 2: The Requirement for Integrability:**
    The "My command" button must be "integrateable with other existing and future shunt buttons." This rule underscores the importance of a clear, well-defined structure and function for "My command." For effective integration, its operational boundaries, input requirements, and expected outputs must be predictable and consistent. An ambiguous "My command" button, whose underlying protocol is undefined, cannot be reliably integrated. For instance, if "My command" is meant to be part of a sequence (e.g., a "CoVe" step followed by a "Negative Constraint" filter), its specific behavior needs to be known beforehand. Without knowing *which* protocol it embodies, or *how* it combines them, its role in a larger system remains uncertain, hindering robust integration.

4.  **Fact 2: The Presence of Four Distinct Protocols/Examples:**
    The text explicitly provides *four distinct examples* or "protocols," each representing a sophisticated, senior-level prompting strategy. Their distinct natures amplify the ambiguity of Rule 1:
    *   **The "Stateful Context" Protocol:** Focuses on maintaining conversational memory and leveraging past interactions. A "My command" button based on this would prioritize context awareness, perhaps referencing previous turns or persistent user preferences.
    *   **The "Negative Constraint" Protocol:** Emphasizes guiding behavior by explicitly defining what *not* to do, thereby preventing undesirable outcomes or hallucinations. A "My command" button here would likely include exclusion criteria, forbidden topics, or anti-patterns.
    *   **The "Chain of Verification" (CoVe) Protocol:** Involves multi-step reasoning, self-correction, and iterative refinement, often through internal monologues or step-by-step checks. A "My command" button based on CoVe would likely break down complex tasks into verifiable sub-steps and include mechanisms for self-evaluation.
    *   **The "Prompt-Refiner" Meta-Protocol:** Operates at a meta-level, focused on improving the quality of *other* prompts through iterative feedback and enhancement. A "My command" button here would be a meta-instruction, perhaps taking an initial prompt as input and outputting an optimized version of it.

    These protocols have differing underlying philosophies, input/output structures, and operational objectives. Selecting one over the others, or attempting to combine them without instruction, would fundamentally alter the nature of the "My command" button. For example, a button optimized for "Stateful Context" would look very different from one focused on "Negative Constraints."

5.  **The Query: The Demand for a Singular Output:**
    The request is to "Create a single shunt button named 'My command' according to the rules." The emphasis on "single" reinforces the expectation of a unified, cohesive output, not a set of options or a collection of disparate functionalities.

6.  **Logical Conclusion: The Inherent Ambiguity:**
    The core logical flaw stems from the direct contradiction between Rule 1's singular reference to "the example bellow" and Fact 2's provision of *four* distinct methodologies.
    *   **Lack of Selection Criteria:** There are no explicit instructions or implicit cues to guide the selection of *one* specific protocol out of the four. Should the selection be based on generality, perceived importance, recency, or some unstated primary objective? Without such criteria, any choice is arbitrary.
    *   **Lack of Synthesis Guidance:** If the intent was to combine elements from all four, the instructions lack any guidance on *how* to synthesize them. Should they be prioritized? Layered? Combined sequentially? How would potentially conflicting principles (e.g., a focus on internal verification vs. a focus on negative constraints) be reconciled into a single, coherent command? Creating a unified protocol from distinct methodologies without explicit instructions is an architectural design decision, not a straightforward implementation.
    *   **Impact on Integrability:** As highlighted by Rule 2, an ambiguously defined "My command" cannot be reliably integrated into a larger system of shunt buttons. Its internal logic and external behavior would be unpredictable.

### Amplified Answer

The query is **categorically ambiguous**, rendering the creation of a definitive "My command" shunt button impossible without further clarification.

The instruction in Rule 1 mandates that "My command" must "follow the example bellow" (singular). However, Fact 2 presents *four distinct and sophisticated "Senior-Level Prompt" examples or protocols*: "Stateful Context," "Negative Constraint," "Chain of Verification (CoVe)," and "Prompt-Refiner." These protocols embody different strategies and serve unique purposes.

Without explicit guidance on the following:
1.  **Which *single* of the four provided examples** is to be followed? (e.g., "Implement 'My command' based *solely* on the 'Chain of Verification' Protocol.")
2.  **What *criteria* should be used to select one specific example** from the four? (e.g., "Select the protocol most relevant to information extraction," or "Choose the most general-purpose protocol.")
3.  **How to *synthesize, combine, or prioritize elements* from *multiple* protocols** into a single cohesive "My command" button? (e.g., "Combine the 'Negative Constraint' protocol with the 'Stateful Context' protocol, prioritizing contextual awareness while applying negative constraints.")

Any attempt to proceed would involve arbitrary selection or speculative synthesis, leading to a "My command" button that may not align with the user's unstated intent. Furthermore, an ambiguously defined "My command" button would inherently violate Rule 2, as its unpredictable behavior and underlying logic would prevent reliable integration with other existing or future shunt buttons.

**Therefore, please clarify which of the four examples should be followed, provide specific criteria for selection, or instruct on how to synthesize them into a single, definitive "My command" button.**
